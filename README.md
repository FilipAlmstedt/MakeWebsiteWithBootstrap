# Assignment - Make a website using Bootstrap
---------------------------------------------------------------

This was the first assignment I had in the course HTML and CSS in my goal to become a Front-end developer.

The assingment was to just make a website/webpage using the framework Boostrap for styling in order for us to become familiar with that frameword. To use cool and useful icons I also used the toolkit Font Awesome.
The website displays some components and layout used in Bootstrap.

The site is responsive using the grid system.
 
Some of the components on the site:
- carousel
- modals
- list-group

Feel free to look using the command: `git clone` to clone the repo and see for yourself.

Have fun!
